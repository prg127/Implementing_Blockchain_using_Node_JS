# Implementing_Blockchain_using_Node_JS
In this project, I have implemented blockchain using proof-of-work and my code is performing basic transactions.
Then I have done socket programming in which new blocks can be formed using console of chrome V8 engine.
Then implementation of merkle tree is done towards the end of this project which is data structure of blockchain

code1, code2 and code3 implements blockchain, proof-of-work and perform transactions. They are working independently.
